# Weather Dashboard

## Description

- Project Motivation: Finish the module 6 assignment and build a funtioning weather app that I can use in my portfolio.

- Purpose: The project was designed to allow a user to see the weather for any city.

- What did it solve: It allows a user to plan for a trip around the weather over the next 5 days.

- What I learned along the way: I learned how to make an API call and use that data to populate a webpage.

## Installation

Steps required to get off the ground: There is nothing required to run the program other than a web client and the file.

## Usage

How to use: You can enter a City and State and then submit that info to get the weather report for the area. After having searched multiple cities you can click back on a button to return you to a previous city.
